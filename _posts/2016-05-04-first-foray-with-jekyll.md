Obligatory *May the fourth be with you*

> Never assume malice when stupidity will suffice.

## Who am I?

My name is Griffin. Up until college, I had met three people wih my name. Then at school there was four of us in my class alone. Great. There went my identity. Not that it would have left anyway, this path I was beginning will prove to be a complete turn over of who I was and how I operated. 

## Where do I start?

I came to college as a physics major. Yes, a physics major. I thought analyzing how stuff moved around our world would have been kinda cool. I was wrong. That class (Phys-151) was the beginning of the worst semester of school in my life. Like, I came out with a 2.2 GPA kind of bad. Nevermind the fact that I was a dumb college freshman who never had attention from girls before, so naturally I latch onto the first one that shows any interest and devote all of my time to her so far that it ruins part of my life and wasted 8 months of my freshman year that I'll never get back.

Ignore all of that for a second. Thats all unimportant now. 

## Where am I now?

Now, meaning the day I started actually building this blog, I'm finishing finals in my junior year. I'm a fully fledged computer science major, a captain of the rowing team, and minutely respected among my peers (I say minutely because I give plenty of reasons to hate me and not a lot to like me).

I never thought I would be where I am today. First, being an adult sucks. Like, the largest cock you can imagine. Having to deal with finding a house, finishing finals, and a championship regatta all in the same week is something I hope to only deal with in college since I'd rather not throw kids into the mix. 

## Where am I going?

Lolnope. Not thinking about that. I hate thinking about that. Why am I thinking about that?

## What now?

My only goal of the week is to get through it. Life is weird, and all I want to do is survive. Thriving can wait for a bit.
